# Pathfinding

## A basic pathfinding app that visualizes a node to node path.

This project is not complete, but (currently) simulates the A* pathfinding algorithm I learned recently on a rectangular grid.

➡️ [LIVE DEMO](https://azboss2021.github.io/pathfinding/)

## What I used/learned:

* Tailwind CSS
* React
* How A* pathfinding works
* Different heuristics
* UI Design

## What could be improved

* Need to add more algorithms
* Make more efficient
* Add more stats (time to create path, time complexities, etc.)
