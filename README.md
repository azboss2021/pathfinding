# Pathfinding

## A basic pathfinding app that visualizes a node to node path.

This project was built for personal curiosity, because I am learning sorting algorithms in school. The app could use some UI work, and possibly more algorithms. Check out the demo below.

## What I used/learned:

* Tailwind CSS
* React
* How A* pathfinding works
* Different heuristics
* UI Design

## What could be improved

* Need to add more algorithms
* Make more efficient
* Add more stats (time to create path, time complexities, etc.)
